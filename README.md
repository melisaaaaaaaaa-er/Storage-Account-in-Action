Storage accounts use containers – the equivalent of a folder or directory on an operating system, or an organizational unit on Windows Server, to separate and organize the content stored within.

To create a container: 
- Select the respective storage account
- Select “Containers” from the left-hand menu
- Select “+ Container”
- Give the container a name
- Select “Create”

To test out the storage account container, create a basic text document on Notepad and save it in Desktop.

Click the “...” at the end of the file row and select “View/edit”.
